# A Comprehensive and Expert Report on Shakepay

## Overview and Origin

The name of the company for this case study is Shakepay. It is a Canadian company based in Montreal.

The company was founded in 2015 by Jean Amiouny, CEO and Roy Breidi, CTO.

The purpose of the company has evolved from the original idea. One day the two founders were having beers and Jean wanted to pay for his in bitcoin (Protocol). The two started working on a way for customers to pay in bitcoin without the merchant having to be involved with bitcoin themselves. Shakepay went through an accelerator and launched their original plan: "provide customers with a card they could load with Bitcoin then spend in physical retail stores" (BrainStation). Their agreements with third-parties, a bank and VISA, did not pan out. Seeking to avoid future reliance on third-parties, the company pivoted to becoming a platform for buying and selling bitcoin. It is generally seen as a crypto exchange but the founders see it as more of a 'bitcoin neobank' (Protocol).

According to Crunchbase, the company has raised 786.5K USD in funding over 4 rounds, with the latest on Feb 22, 2018 from a seed round. They are funded by three institutions in total: two Canadian non-profits, Creative Destruction Lab (CDL) and NEXT Canada, and Boost VC, a Silicon Valley accelerator and venture capital firm.

## Business Activities:

The specific financial problem the company is trying to solve is getting Canadians to own and use bitcoin. To solve this problem, "Shakepay allows Canadians to buy/sell bitcoin and pay their friends" (Shakepay About). Their broader mission is to "create open access to building wealth" (Shakepay About). They have integrated funding or withdrawing by means of e-transfer or wire transfer, in CAD, which solves the problem of easy online accessability in a more instantaneous way. Their website also allows trading Ethereum to CAD only, and not a ETH-BTC exchange. This is suited for people that do banking in Canada and want to convert their ethereum or bitcoin to spend in Canadian dollars.

According to Shakepay, their services are intended for "Canadians from all walks of life — college students to retirees — use Shakepay to connect with the digital economy built on the Internet". There is some information that provides a general idea of the market size of their customers. The population of adult Canadians for 2021 is around 30 million (StatsCanada). It is currently estimated that 3.2% or 1.2 million Canadians own bitcoin with ownership increasing between 2016 and 2018 (Triple-A). In terms of value, the  global cryptocurrency market is expected to reach 4.94 billion USD by 2020 (Yahoo Finance). The market cap of cryptocurrencies is 2.8 trillion USD with bitcoin in the lead with over $1 trillion. (CoinMarketCap).

Shakepay offers commission-free buying and selling of bitcoin from desktop or mobile. This is a feature of most crypto exchanges that offer services to Canada. They may differentiate by offering different transfer options or excellent customer service. Customers can also earn bitcoin by literally shaking their phones (Wealthsimple). They use the Lightning Network for instantaneous payments and lower fees. They allow ethereum-CAD exchange, bitcoin-CAD exchange, and transfers to Canadian banking accounts.

They are using the ethereum and bitcoin blockchains and they are implemented by exchanging each into Canadian Dollars exclusively, by means of withdraw (sell) or purchase (fund/buy). Crunchbase's technological report page states that use at least 15 products including HTMl5, Google analytics, Google fonts. Their website is always connected with an https:// so they must be using SSL encryption. Shakepay's career offer as a full-stack developer requires experience with Node.js (dynamic trade execution), React-Native (mobile apps), Vue (web interface), Postgres, Docker/Kubernetes (scaling), and machine learning for fraud detection. Postgres coincides with Shakepay having a large database of users and Node.js matches their front page having JavaScript tags. For infrastructure they use Amazon Web Services. They apply the principles of DevOps that include continuous improvement/continuous deployment (CI/CD) and ensuring high software quality.

## Landscape:

Shakepay is in the blockchain and cryptocurrency domain of the financial industry. Blockchain and cryptocurrency began with bitcoin in 2008-2009. A practical proof of Moore's law, where the number of transistors on a microchip doubles about every 2 years, and this has been shown in the growth of all cryptocurrencies, so it could be predicted that the market cap within 2 years could be 5-6 trillion USD. It was first given monetary value when 10,000 coins were exchanged for two pizzas (Yahoo News). 

Major trends over the last 5-10 years in this domain is price volatility and the steady but final adoption of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in regulated financial markets and the mainstream in general (Yahoo News, Forbes 1). 
- more people owning, buying/selling, investing/speculating
- more people using it for transactions, higher volume of transactions, more $ value
- more venues taking it as valid currency
- major institutions VISA, RBC
- some athletes taking salary in bitcoin (Athletes), next New York mayor (Twitter)

Bank of Canada's report, "Bitcoin Awareness and Usage in Canada: An Update" released in July 2018, indicates that the level of awareness of bitcoin as well as ownership increased to 85% and 5%. The main reason for ownership changed from for transactions to for investments. In the report, Figure 1 "Price and number of Bitcoin transactions, 2012–18 (monthly average)" shows that while the price was stable between 2014 and 2016, the number of transactions steadily increased. This may be evidence to support that people are willing to use cryptocurrency as long as it holds its value. A sharp decrease can be seen once the price starts increasing drastically in 2017.

Some negative trends are the potential for scams and memecoins that are pump and dumps, and for cryptocurrency to be stolen from platforms or exchanges.

Major innovations include the creation of financial instruments such as ETFs to support the demand for bitcoin and the creation of altcoins and stablecoins. Altcoins such as ethereum, litecoin, and dogecoin, and stablecoins such as Tether, TrueUSD, and USDCoin (Forbes 2) provide alternatives with varying degrees of stability for investors to choose from. JP Morgan even has their own coin JPMCoin. ICOs, or Initial Coin Offerings, are a new way to launch cryptocurrency and raise funds to develop the cryptocurrency system (Investopedia).

It is worth mentioning that blockchain is also thriving outside of the fintech industry. Forbes summarizes it best: "companies are investing in research and development consistently and increasingly in this sector. Inventions in this area cover activities in tracking, finance, mobile wallets and e-commerce. Cryptocurrency, tokenization and, more importantly, blockchain technologies are becoming increasingly common in the applications for networks and computing, security, industrial applications and securities." (Forbes 3)

There are many competitors in this domain. Other major companies in this domain are: Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin, Netcoins, Kraken, Wealthsimple, Newton, Bitbuy, NDAX, bitcoin ATM Machines (BitcoinRobin, Localcoin), and independent traders on Paxful or LocalBitcoins. All of these competitors feature low to no fees and a variety of methods to transfer and exchange funds to dollars or coins with methods outside of the traditional e-transfer or EFT payments, (Paypal, Western Union, Zelle). Some competitors also offer a broader selection of coins than just ethereum and bitcoin, (other altcoins such as Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum Classic, Solana) (Reviewlution)

## Results

Shakepay has been successful in getting bitcoins into the hands of Canadians. Their platform is evidence that there's demand for cryptocurrency, bitcoin in particular, in Canada.

The company reports on the number of Canadians using Shakepay and the total dollar amount of transactions. Their about page shows that over 700,000 Canadians have made $4 billion in transactions. Their blog has posts over time that show an increase in the number of users. As of November 2021, 800,000 or 2% of Canadians are using Shakepay. In May 2021 they reached 600,000 users. In March 2021 they reached over 380,000 users which was about 1% of Canadians. In October 2020 they passed over $500 million in transactions. By these numbers it appears the company is performing well, especially in the last 12 months or so which aligns with the adoption of blockchain and cryptocurrency by the mainstream. 

## Recommendations

The company seems focused on bitcoin and they've only allowed ethereum as an alternative coin on their platform. One major advice is to keep an open mind and an eye out for other altcoins that they believe in as much as bitcoin. 

Allowing more coins on the platform will benefit the company by attracting clients that are either interested in other coins entirely or want more coins in addition to their bitcoin and ethereum holdings, all in the same place.

An ICO, or Initial Coin Offering might also be of interest to Shakepay. Shakepay's own coin might allow them to achieve their vision to "create open access to building wealth". The steps involved in doing an ICO, according to Investopedia: detail how the system works in a whitepaper and then market it. The first step involves being highly knowledgeable on blockchain and cryptocurrency.
